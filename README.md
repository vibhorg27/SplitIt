# Split It

## *Vibhor Gupta*

**Split It** computes the tip and total amount for a bill and split the total amount and tip between the number of persons that id fed. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and Total amount and Split amount to calculate the respective split and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following functionality is completed:

* [*] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [*] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [*] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [*] The user sees a label update based on the tip amount.
* [*] User can see the total amount and tip split.
* [*] The split dynamically changes when the number of person changes (same as the tip percentage seek bar).
